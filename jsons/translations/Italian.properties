I look around and see that others have begun to build bases. Operation centers made of steel. But not us. Because the true home is not some building made of lead, but rather the people around you. Surround yourself with them. And you'l be home forever. =

Hex Corporation =

'I will tell you a secret. Truth is, I'm not human. Not fully, at least. For some reason, Hexlock decided that it would be best having a computer lead them, instead of a person.

At the Refuge, I am creating more than a town, more even than a polity; it is a new world, where individuals will be free to act without the burden of taxation or the specter of injustice. Here, I have created a truly voluntary society, where the citizens associate in rational self interest; from love, not from fear of punishment. I have sent you this invitation because you have greatness within you; think of all you have achieved in your life, and how much more you could do, if you were not held back. Choose something different. Choose Atlas. =

Now there are no doors left in the houses for they have all been kicked off. So, also, there are no fires in the village and have not been for many days.

After the bombs came the robots, bathed in metal. They did more damage to the great nations of old than the bombs ever did. They were ruthless. Killed anything that lived, it didn't matter who, or where. Not even the bunkers were safe. =

Recover Transmission #4 = 
 # Requires translation!
In a time when perhaps we all had lost hope, a sliver of hope appeared. We never knew where the robots came from. But there were rumors of a guy that went around fearlessly destroying them. And just as they came, one day they were all gone. Some of us didn't believe it. But we knew. The Hero was real. We've seen him. =

Recover Transmission #5 =

Just as if he existed solely for his mission, the Hero vanished. But some of us will remember him forever. Down 2/3 of our people. Supplies had run out. The atmosphere was toxic, but survivable. It was time to head out. =

When we came out, we saw many trying to remake their own societies, making the same mistakes of old. This might be my last entry. But we found it.

But the Flame had mercy upon the people, and spared the people who repented and swore to serve the Engine.
