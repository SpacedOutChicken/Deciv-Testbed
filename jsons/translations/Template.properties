In the beginning, the earth was without form, cold and void. And the Divine Engine moved upon the face of the earth, and brought forth humans, to serve her. And she blessed the people upon the earth with steel and holy oil, to make engines of their own. But the people of the earth forgot the Divine Engine who had blessed them. So the Engine sent forth the Flame to destroy the people who had sinned, and the earth was cleansed. But the Flame had mercy upon the people, and spared the people who repented and swore to serve the Engine. And it came to pass that Divine Engine blessed the people once more, and gave them steel and holy oil, and commanded them to multiply and replenish the earth, for the engine's glory. = 
 # Requires translation!
Now the people of the earth have begun to forgot the Engine once more. We are called to spread the word of our god, and compel the nations of the earth to repent and serve the Engine. The wrath of the Flame goes before us, and the strength of the Engine is behind us. We are Ignis, and we cannot fail. =

This has been a challenging quarter with falls in demand from states and agencies.
